1. Data Preparation
Loads insurance data from insurance.csv.

Creates new features:
    - bmi: Body Mass Index, calculated from weight and height.
    - age_group: Categorizes age into "young", "adult", "middle_aged", "senior".
    - lifestyle_risk: Based on whether the person is a smoker and their BMI:
        "high": smoker and BMI > 30
        "medium": smoker or BMI > 25
        "low": otherwise
    - city_tier: Assigns a tier (1, 2, or 3) to the city based on predefined lists.


2. Feature Selection
Selects these features for the model:
        bmi
        age_group
        lifestyle_risk
        city_tier
        income_lpa (income in lakhs per annum)
        occupation

3. Model Pipeline
    Uses a ColumnTransformer to:
    One-hot encode categorical features (age_group, lifestyle_risk, occupation, city_tier)
    Pass through numeric features (bmi, income_lpa)
    Trains a RandomForestClassifier to predict the target: insurance_premium_category.


4. Prediction
    The model predicts the insurance_premium_category for a given set of features.
    The categories are likely:
    low: The person is expected to pay a low insurance premium (lower risk).
    medium: The person is expected to pay a medium insurance premium (moderate risk).
    high: The person is expected to pay a high insurance premium (higher risk).


What Each Category Signifies
    low: The user is considered low risk (e.g., non-smoker, healthy BMI, younger, safe occupation/city), so the insurance premium is low.
    medium: The user has some risk factors (e.g., smoker or high BMI, middle-aged, moderate occupation/city risk), so the premium is moderate.
    high: The user is high risk (e.g., smoker and high BMI, older, risky occupation/city), so the premium is high.


Summary:
Your model uses demographic and lifestyle features to classify users into low, medium, or high insurance premium categories, which reflect their risk level as assessed by the model.
